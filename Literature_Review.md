Poverty Alleviation: Tourism Industry Investment, Economic Development and Industrial Structure Optimization in Southwest China


Abstract


Based on the relevant panel data of five provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in Southwest China from 2000 to 2016, this paper constructs a PVAR model to study the dynamic relationship between tourism industry investment, economic development and industrial structure optimization in Southwest China. It is found that there is a close relationship between tourism industry investment, economic development and industrial structure optimization in Southwest China during the observation period. From GMM estimation results, we can see that the three factors promote each other in the current period; from impulse response and variance decomposition, we can see that the growth of tourism industry investment mainly depends on itself and has a low impact on industrial structure optimization and economic development; Although the influence of economic development and industrial structure optimization mainly comes from the fluctuation of the industry itself, the mutual influence between economic development and industrial structure optimization shows a trend of rapid and steady growth.

Rob kitchen stressed the importance of measurement as an important factor in improving the description and analysis of complex natural and / or social phenomena. How did the emergence of big data push the measurement revolution? Then, how did the measurement revolution promote data science into an interdisciplinary research field? Knowledge driven data uses a method, that is, to calculate by one method, ignoring all other factors. As technology advances, continuing to use this approach will make progress useless. With the progress of science and technology, more data can be obtained, which can be used in the conclusion process to help better understand the data.

The author maintain the importance of models and human intervention in science. It is true that relying solely on computers can save time to formulate hypotheses and avoid the deviation of human operation. However, in some fields of Social Sciences, such as art or analysis of the composition of geographical concentration of different ethnic groups, many factors cannot be quantified or processed by machines. Moreover, humans are likely to be irrational, so they don't necessarily follow the general rules. Human society is complex, human activities are often affected by emergencies, so that human behavior is difficult to predict.

Statistical model, however, create economic efficiency by providing more productive data.

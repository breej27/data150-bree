my response

In many perspectives, digital makes a lot of conveniences in our daily life. By using algorithms, people now are more like data sets waiting to be analyzed from our personal interests to our financial status. In early days, this development was described as a  “time-saving process”, or “handing people more skillful jobs”. While making those conveniences, we started to care more about privacy. In this way, it is very hard to find a “middle point” in order to balance those two aspects. My view of data science is broadened since it mentioned many pitfalls received after the development of data science, which people would hardly notice.

Personally, even though I acknowledge that many apps I am using are taking away my privacy, I am still using it, because I feel it is important to communicate with my families and friends. It is also hard to establish a general standard of privacy and transparency on a worldwide scale since we have so many countries and cultures. Even if the “balancing act” was established, I highly doubt the acceptance of people from all over the world.

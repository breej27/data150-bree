PVAR


Taking Southwest China as a whole as the research object, this paper selects the panel data of Southwest China from 2000 to 2016 to establish the panel vector autoregressive model (PVAR) model, combined with impulse response and variance decomposition to explore the dynamic relationship among economic development, tourism industry investment and industrial structure optimization, in order to get an objective judgment and provide reference for the formulation of public policy in Southwest China.


As the three core departments of the tourism industry, tourist hotels, scenic spots and travel agencies are the core carriers of regional tourism reception and the key areas of tourism investment, which gather the capital, talent, technology, brand and other resources of regional tourism investment.The most direct manifestation of the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure is that the proportion of the primary industry in the GDP has decreased, while the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries has increased. Considering that the overall industrial structure optimization of Southwest China is at a low level, and the industrial structure of Tibet Autonomous Region, Guizhou Province and Yunnan Province is gradually transforming from the primary industry to the secondary and tertiary industries, the proportion of non-agricultural output value to GDP is adopted to reflect the industrial structure optimization level. Considering the reliability and availability of data, GDP is selected as the index to measure the regional economic development. The relevant data are from the statistical yearbook, statistical bulletin of national economic and social development, government work report and China Tourism Statistical Yearbook of the provinces in Southwest China. For missing and abnormal values, multiple interpolation methods and regression interpolation methods are adopted to improve the data.

Yit-j is the J-order lag term of Yit, that is, the lag term of an endogenous variable is the explanatory variable. I is the province in Southwest China, t is the year, P is the lag order, η Is the individual effect vector, γ T is the time effect vector, β J is the coefficient matrix, μ i. T is the random interference term.


In order to avoid the phenomenon of pseudo regression in PVAR model and ensure the stability of impulse response and variance decomposition, we use stata15.0 software to test the panel data with LLC (homogeneous unit root) test method and iPS (heterogeneous unit root) test method. If the panel data pass the test, it is considered that the panel data is stable; Otherwise, it is considered that the panel data is not stable. In order to eliminate the possible heteroscedasticity phenomenon in the series, logarithmic processing is adopted for tourism industry investment, economic development and industrial structure optimization respectively, and the cointegration

1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?

In his book 'Development as Freedom' the Nobel prize winning economist, Amartya Sen, defines development as: “enlarging people's choices, capabilities and freedoms, so that they can live a long and healthy life, have access to knowledge, a decent standard of living, and participate in the life of their community.” There is now widespread acceptance of Sen's view that development should be judged not only on the basis of increases in average incomes, but on whether it creates the circumstances for people like this young woman to exercise their choices, capabilities and freedoms. But judging development by its effects on people does not mean that development is the sum of improvements in the well being of people or the output of firms. In this talk I argue that we should think of development as a property of the economy.

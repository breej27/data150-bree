What is development?

Development expands our freedom in many different ways, including economy and opportunity. Development is not to be richer, but to have more freedom. Freedom in different forms and views, the definition of freedom is different, there is no unified definition. For example, with the development of transportation, freedom of travel. The development of transportation makes it easier to go to a place, while the early development makes it more difficult to go from point a to point B.

Is this an expansive or narrow view of development?

I think this is a broad outlook on development. Instead of focusing on economic factors such as money, the book links development with more liberal factors. Development should be expanded so that people can benefit from the whole society, rather than focusing on the tools reflecting development, such as the growth of gross national product. For example, some countries with higher GNP may actually have shorter life expectancy than other poorer countries.

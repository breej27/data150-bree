**Research Idea**

Southwest China mainly includes the Sichuan Basin, Yunnan Guizhou Plateau, the south of Qinghai Tibet Plateau and the west of Guangdong and Guangxi hills. The complex topography has always restricted the traffic development in Southwest China. Some poor areas are too remote or even isolated from the world because of their geographical location, and the blocked traffic can not meet the needs of economic development and production activities in Southwest China. Therefore, most of the investment funds and advanced technologies are concentrated in the eastern region where the transportation is convenient and the infrastructure is perfect. The communication between the southwest region and the outside world is difficult, and it is difficult to introduce funds and technologies, which widens the gap between the southwest region and the eastern region.

By analyzing the geographical location and natural environment of the population distribution in the poverty-stricken areas in Southwest China, we can find that most of the poverty-stricken counties in Southwest China are located in areas with poor natural environment, and the population growth rate in these areas is often at a high level. Population growth is too fast, coupled with the backward infrastructure, often at the expense of the environment to obtain economic development, the contradiction between man and nature is serious, these areas are very easy to fall into the ecological environment and poverty cycle.

Based on the panel data of five provinces and autonomous regions in Southwest China from 2000 to 2016, this paper constructs a pvar model to study the dynamic relationship between tourism industry investment, economic development and industrial structure optimization in Southwest China. It is found that there is a close relationship between tourism industry investment, economic development and industrial structure optimization in Southwest China during the observation period. According to GMM estimation results, there is a mutual promotion relationship among the three in this period. From impulse response and variance decomposition, we can see that tourism industry investment mainly depends on its own industrial progress, and its impact on industrial structure optimization and economic development is at a low level. Although the impact of economic development and industrial structure optimization mainly comes from its own industrial fluctuations, the interaction between economic development and industrial structure optimization shows a rapid and stable growth trend.

**Novel Hypothesis**

First of all, we are going to conduct the GMM method in order to test the efficiency of Inclusive Finance. Taking 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China as samples, this
